# Occupancy-abundance-model
An occupancy-abundance model for abundance mediated species interactions

Currently in this repo is a simulator for a three-species version occupancy-abundance model with a binomial observation model, and also a case study example of the three-species model with a Poisson observation model for camera trapping data.
